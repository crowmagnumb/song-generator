wait for you


when it came time to wait for you,
I took the bus to malibu.
found a cafe by the ocean
watched the sky for signs

and a rainbow in the west
wrapped its coils around the earth like a serpent.
I felt like I was going to suffocate.

but I knew this was not the day you would finally come my way.
but I waited all the same,
watched the water through the window.

and a rainbow in the west
held its head beneath the waves and grew dimmer.
nothing anyone could do I suppose.
