earth air water trees


through the shifting colors in the sky
i heard the wild geese call.
and the light was bright and clear and cold
over eastern montreal
and although, i know
you're only toying with me now,
and although, i know
you hold your affection for me like a bone on a string
i love you, i love you because
you gave me sausage and cheese when i was hungry.

you hold your closed hand out to me
and you told me to guess what you had inside
and i had a thousand guesses and some of them were good
but i knew for sure that i was losing my mind
when the scent came rising
through the spaces between your fingers
when the scent called to me
and i knew we'd last at least until the end of december
i love you, i love you because
you gave me sausage and cheese when i was hungry.
