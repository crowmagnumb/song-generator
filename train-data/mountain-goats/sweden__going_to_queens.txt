going to queens


the ghostly sing-song 
of the children playing double-dutch. 
I felt the wind come through the window 
I felt it turn around and switch back. 
in the second story room 
in jamaica queens 
your hair was dripping wet. 
your skin was clean. 
and the children skipping rope 
tripled their speed 
you were all I'd ever wanted 
you were all I'd ever need. 
in new york city 
in the middle of july 
the air was heavy and wet 
the air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine. 
I will know who you are yet. 
I will know who you are yet.
