Lemon


If you cut a lemon in half
You'll have two distinct pieces
Each one representing
One half of a lemon
Yet now,
Its not so much of a lemon
As it is two distinct pieces
Of that lemon
Licking the lemon juice off the knife
Is dangerous
Imagine cutting the corner of your mouth
And then lemon juice
Ouch
But you already know that the knife
had little, if anything, to do
With creating two distinct pieces
Of that lemon
Sure, the rind and the pulp
Were split by serrated metal
(The wooden handle a little loose from when dad
did the funny thing with his teeth)
