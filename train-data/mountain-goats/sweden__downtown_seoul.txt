downtown seoul


there was a new song on the air. 
I saw you coming across the square. 
and a white bird broke the dark korean sky 
as the rest of my life went by 

I had your warm hand on my face. 
I took your index finger in between my teeth, 
and I held it gently in place. 
it was resting lightly on my tongue in there. 
I saw you shaking in the cold korean air. 
[and] there but for the grace of the lord of song 
I would be this very second and I'm coming right along. 
you had your cardigan on. 
I looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone. 
I remember your eyelids. 
I remember your body now.
