going to georgia


the most remarkable thing about coming home to you is the feeling of being in motion again
it's the most extraordinary thing in the world
i have two big hands and a heart pumping blood and a 1967 colt .45 with a busted safety catch
the world shines as i cross the macon county line
going to georgia

the most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you
and that you're standing in the doorway
and you smile as you ease the gun from my hand and i'm frozen with joy right where i stand
the world throws its light underneath your hair
forty miles from atlanta, this is nowhere
going to georgia

the world shines as i cross the macon county line
going to georgia
