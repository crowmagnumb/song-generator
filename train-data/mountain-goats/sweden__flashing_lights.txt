flashing lights


I am wearing a white long sleeved button-down. 
the pink colors behind the clouds tonight 
mirror the softer shades of your nightgown 
as the neuro-transmitters go crazy inside of me 
you swear you're leaving town 
empty promises empty promises. 

I am watching the way the wind seems to pass straight through your body. 
when you run your fingernail along my neck, you spill some water on me. 

you say you're as good as gone 
well, don't look now but here comes the dawn 
empty promises empty promises. 
empty promises empty promises.
