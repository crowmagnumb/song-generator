I am ready for my close up today
too long I've let my self-respect stand in my way
well the prom queen's caught in the high beams
and the strings keen it's a big scene

but when the house goes up in flames
no one emerges triumphantly from it
when the scum begins to circle the drain
everybody loves a winner

I spent eight hours in my make-up chair
waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair
well the fire's bright and the frame's tight
try to get right; well, we've still got light

but when the house goes up in flames
no one emerges triumphantly from it
when the scum begins to circle the drain
everybody loves a winner

but when the house goes up in flames

when the scum begins to circle the drain
