john: oh you don't want to start like that? you want me to do the thing.

while I wondered what you were waiting for 
I saw the wild strawberries on the vine

felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil

the air around you was familiar to me now 
if you were gazing westward 
I was looking at you again 
yeah.
