one winter at point alpha privative


what the hell kind of deal is it here anyway?
how much does it cost and how long can you stay?
should we dance? should we sing? should we curse? should we pray?
do I have to hang on every single word that you say?
every hour, every minute, every second of the day
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

what the hell's going on at the edges of your face
there's nothing you can do, would it leave a single trace
will it take your pretty features and lay them all to waste
can we sit down over there, can we sit down any place
can you feel the spirit moving, can you feel god's grace
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

ever since I've married you I've wondered what it means
that every single shirt I owned has busted at the seams
every single piece of clothing, every last pair of jeans,
all the reds, all the whites, all the yellows, all the greens.
i'm sure that there's a reason all of this is happening.
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
