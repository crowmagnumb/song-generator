the black ice cream song


and the heat came down (2x)
i knew i was living in a long, long dream
when you fed me the black ice cream

and the heat rose up (2x)
i heard the loud loud buzzing of our son's go-kart
and the ice cream was blacker than the devil's heart
it was august the 19th, 1957
i fixed my eyes on you, fixed my eyes on you
