alibi


I got off work just past eleven
laid one finger to the breeze.
you can almost taste the action
on nights like these.
trees were bending in the wind.
you were forty miles away.
and I was headed in your direction.
I've been waiting all day, I've been waiting all day.

moon over west covena was huge and white.
and I was like a patient on a table,
headed for the light
lean toward the center divider
feel the wind in my hair
keep a light up in your window
I'm gonna be right there, I'm gonna be right there

with a gleam in my eye
and an almost airtight alibi.

down by the chemistry building
I found a quiet place to park.
and I made my way down the street toward your place
stepping lightly in the dark
climbed the steps up to your doorway
like a man prepared to jump underneath a train.
it's real warm outside tonight.
maybe tomorrow it rains, maybe tomorrow it rains.

inside your room we shut the window
and we turned on a fan.
and we lay there together in the darkness
I can keep a secret if you can.
finishing one another's sentences
like a pair of identical twins.
your boyfriend's out of town until tuesday
and nobody saw me come in, nobody saw me come in.

with a gleam in my eye
and an almost airtight alibi.
