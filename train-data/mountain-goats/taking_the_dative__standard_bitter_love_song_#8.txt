standard bitter love song #8


I went down to lloyd center looking for you. 
but a mouth full of anger blocked my view. 
he took your hand there in the skating the rink. 
god will give him blood to drink. 

saw the two of you leaving. 
I didn't want to follow behind. 
but I could see the rest of your evening, 
burning in my mind. 

the sky's black. the moon's pink. 
god will give him blood to drink. 

I looked over the railing. ice was white 
on the northeast side where I saw you and your boyfriend 
on a friday night. 
I went mining for gold. I struck pure, fresh zinc. 
god, god will give him blood to drink. 

hey, hey, hey.
