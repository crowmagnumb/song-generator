sail babylon springs


but meanwhile downstairs, I'm setting up shop.
a little too proud to let the matter drop
and I can hear you up there.
isn't it romantic?
you're huffing and puffing rearranging
deck chairs on the titanic.
and I reach for a glass of cool water drawn,
from the rivers of babylon.

and meanwhile outside, the stars have come out.
and the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout.
and you stand at your window looking down,
and I spread wide my arms.
jump if you want to jump, jump if you want to.
the water's warm.

I know.
I know 'cause i've been swimming.
blindly along through the rivers of babylon.
