sinaloan milk snake song


(everybody ready? uh yeah! um-hmm.)
sun melts everything down, and the hills are reduced to nothing
the whole house shakes, and you can see that the coach is coming
you lean down and you pick up the small soft eggs in the dust outside my door
i hold them in my hands, they are warm and the air is warming up now

i've got a message for you, if i could only remember
i've got a message for you, but you're gonna have to come and get it
la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la

ever since i came here, all i could think about is water
last night they brought the fat lamb in from the fold
but i couldn't bring myself to do anything about it
i remember california, i remember malibu
i remember the states and the names of the cities but i don't remember you

and i've got a message for you, if i could only remember
i've got a message for you, but you're gonna have to come and get it
i've got a message for you, i've got a message for you, 2 3 4
la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la (2x, etc.)
ya!
whoo
