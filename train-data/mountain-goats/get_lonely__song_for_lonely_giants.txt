song for lonely giants


no one washed behind my ears.
high in the trees alone for years,
practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons
watching them go where they will go.

face in the leaves, song in my throat.
fall through the air, hoping to float.
practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy,
too heavy to carry.
watching them go where they will go.
