the rain song


the rain came down
soaked the old habachi
and i wish i could sing, like allen callaci
and then you would know
how sad it was, when the rain came down

drop by drop
gallon by gallon
brother if i could sing,
if i could sing like allen
you would know
and understand how sad it was when the rain came down
