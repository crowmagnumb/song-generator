Rain In Soho


No one knows where the lone wolf sleeps
No one sees the hidden treasure in the castle keep (no, no, no, no)
No one learns the secret name
No one burns in the absent flame (no, no, no, no)

No one broke D.B. Cooper's fall
No one hopes to hear the bagmen call (no, no, no, no)
Children piping in the main square
But no one's dancing
No one's dancing down there (no, no, no, no)

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

No promise sweeter than a blood pact
Nothing harder to go through with than a vanishing act (no, no, no, no)
No morning colder than the first frost
No friends closer than the ones we've lost (no, no, no, no)

Nothing sharper than a serpent's tooth
Nothing harder than the gospel truth (no, no, no, no)
Though you repent, and don sackcloth and try to make nice
You can't cross the same river twice

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

There's a club where you'd like to go
You could meet someone who's lost like you
Revel in the darkness like a pair of open graves
Fumble though the fog for a season or two

No town more barren than our town
No haven safer than the one they tore down
No greater love than to lay my life down for a friend
No sweeter pleasure than to see the credits clear through to the end
(No, no, no, no)

No one knows where the lone wolf's gone
No one sees him camped out right there on the front lawn (no, no, no, no)
We played for you but you would not sing
No one was gonna get away with anything (no, no, no, no)

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
