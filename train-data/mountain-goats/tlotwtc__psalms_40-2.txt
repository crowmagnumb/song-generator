Psalms 40:2


Pulled off the highway in Missouri and lo, our hearts were heavy laden
Made for the chapel with some spray paint for all the things we'd held in secret
Lord, lift up these lifeless bones
Light cascading through the windows, all the rainbow's heavy tones

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Left that place in ruin, drunk on the spirit and high on fumes
Checked into a Red Roof Inn, stayed up for several hours and then slept like infants
In the burning fuselage of my days
Let my mouth be ever fresh with praise

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Each morning new
Each day shot through
With all the sharp, small shards of shrapnel
That seem to burst out of me and you

Head down for Kansas, we will get there when we get there, don't you worry
Feel bad about the things we do along the way, but not really that bad
We inhaled the frozen air
Lord, send me a mechanic if I'm not beyond repair

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and he will set me high
