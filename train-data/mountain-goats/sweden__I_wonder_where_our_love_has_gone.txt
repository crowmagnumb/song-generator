I wonder where our love has gone


spoken: I who have sat by thebes below the wall and walked 
among the lowest of the dead 

all I know is I'm in love with you 
even though you say that we are through 
I know without your love I just can't go on 
I wonder where our love has gone. 

always thought you'd love me more and more. 
never dreamed you'd ever let me go. 
I know without your love I just can't go on. 
I wonder where our love has gone. 

now what did I do 
and what did I say 
that ever could lead you to treat me this way? 
if I've been untrue, I'm willing to pay. 
and darling if that's not enough I'll do anything you say. 
so darling please wherever you may be, 
hear my plea. 
and hurry home to me. 
I know without your love I just can't go on. 
I wonder where our love has gone.
