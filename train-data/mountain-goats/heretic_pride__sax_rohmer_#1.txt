sax rohmer #1


fog lifts from the harbor
dawn goes down to day
an agent crests the shadows
of a nearby alleyway

piles of broken bricks
signposts on the path
every moment points toward
the aftermath, yeah

sailors straggle back
from their nights out on the town
hopeless urchins from the city
gather around
spies from imperial china
wash in with the tide
every battle heads toward
surrender on both sides

and I am coming home to you
with my own blood in my mouth
and I am coming home to you
if it's the last thing that I do

bells ring in the tower
wolves howl in the hills
chalkmarks show up
on a few high windowsills

and a rabbit gives up somewhere
and a dozen hawks descend
every moment leads toward
its own sad end, yeah

ships loosed from their moorings
capsize and then they're gone
sailors with no captains watch a while
and then move on

and an agent crests the shadows
and I head in her direction
all roads lead toward
the same blocked intersection

I am coming home to you
with my own blood in my mouth
and I am coming home to you
if it's the last thing that I do
