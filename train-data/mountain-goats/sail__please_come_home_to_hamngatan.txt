leave fingerprints on everything
jewel thieves, jewel thieves
leave fingerprints on everything
but around here, around here,
we don't dust for fingerprints.

snake oil peddlers,
we can spot 'em half a mile away
but these days, these days,

adulterers, adulterers,
always give themselves away
but down here, around here
where the moose run wild,
and you can't think clearly
we let 'em off pretty easy.
