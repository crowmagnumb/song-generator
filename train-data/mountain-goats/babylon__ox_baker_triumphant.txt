ox baker triumphant


I will rise from the swamp where they dumped my private plane,
I'll be clutching the life preserver in my teeth.
and I will find the highway
and I will flag down a truck 
worry lines on my forehead, blank stare underneath

and when I come back to town 
I'm gonna cast my burden down
a little worse for wear
practically walking on air

I will thank my ride and crawl my way back inside 
to the guts of the building where my enemies
hide in the dark like roaches.
and I will signal the camera crew and everyone will do
what he's been trained how to do.
sweat dripping from my face as my moment approaches.

click your heels, count to three.
I bet you never expected me
a little worse for wear
practically walking on air
