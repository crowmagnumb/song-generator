how to embrace a swamp creature


got out of bed, could not remember my own name
condemned to walk the soil amongst all creatures wild and tame
go where I go, do what I must
crawl starving on my belly
licking up the dry dust

I see the light in your window
ride the elevator to the sixth floor
stand with my arms at my sides as you open up the door

but I'm out of my element I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe

alone with your bathroom mirror
try to get my head straight
breathe on the glass and wait for it to clear
clean slate

meet up with you in the kitchen
where the air is hot and dry
open up all the faucets
be fruitful and multiply

I stand where the flashing swords gleam
and I try to shake my head clear of the dream
but I'm out of my element I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe

I start to sweat I can't cool down
I'm scared of all the strangers in this town
I try to tell you just why i've come
it's like I've got molasses on my tongue

I made it through town somehow
but who's going to save me now?
i'm out of my element I can't breathe
i'm out of my element
I can't breathe
