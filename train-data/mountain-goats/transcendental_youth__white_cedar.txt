White Cedar


Like a star come down to walk the Earth
In radiant array
I saw the light of my spirit
Descend the other day

I was standing by the bus stop
On North East 33rd
When I got the word

I will be made a new creature
One bright day

I don't have to be afraid
Speed that day on it's way
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true
Can you?

Woke up on lockdown one more time
My visions won't ever learn
But I see the light that much clearer
Every time I return

Forge my armor in the old fire
My spirit sings loud and clear
Even in here

I'll be reborn someday, someday
If I wait long enough

I don't have to be afraid
I don't wanna be afraid.
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true
Can you?
