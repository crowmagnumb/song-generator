Elijah


streak the windows.
smear the walls with coconut oil, yeah.
fill a cast iron kettle with water and magnolia blossom.
let it boil.
let the water roll.
let the fire take its toll.
i'm coming home.
i'm coming home.

dust off the idols.
give them something to eat.
i think they're hungry.
i know i'm starving half to death.

i know you're waiting.
i know you've been waiting for a long long time.
and i'm coming home.
i'm coming home.

set the table.
those three extra places --
one for me,
one for your doubts,
and one for god.

let the incense burn in every room.
feel the fullness of time in the empty tomb.
feel the future kicking in your womb.
i'm coming home.
i'm coming home.
