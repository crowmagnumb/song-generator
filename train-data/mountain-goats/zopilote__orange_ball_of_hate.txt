orange ball of hate


when i hear the screeching weather vane
in the wild wind and the pissing rain
i know that one of us, i'm not saying who,
has got rocks in her head
the rain comes through the open window
but you don't think so
i sure do love you (2x)

when i notice that the radio is broken
i see you standing there in the doorway soaking
the water drizzles off of you down to the floor
and i say that i don't want to live in new england anymore
some flower petals stick to your skin
i grab hold of your hip,  and i pull you in

when the building establishes control
when the thunder from the north begins to roll down our way
i know i've been right all along
and you start singing that stupid children's song
you think i don't know it
but i just don't feel like singing it
sure do love you
i sure do love you
