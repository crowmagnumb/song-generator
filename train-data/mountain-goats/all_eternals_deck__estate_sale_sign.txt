Estate Sale Sign


Crude little wooden idols and aviator shades
The trinkets and the treasures we brought back from the crusades
Some guy in an Impala shakes his head when he rides by
But I remember when we shared a vision, you and I

Worked hard to build this altar, we made it earn its keep
The cracks across its surface spiderweb while we're asleep
The sacrificial stains all spread out and soaking through
But I remember when we kept it pretty, me and you

And high above the water the eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in this jungle is gonna get his wish

Stockshots, stupid stockshots from the Pamona mall
Set up like unloved icons gathering dust up on the wall
From films no one remembers they call down silently
But I remember when their names were dear to you and me

Pennies on the dollar, everything's gotta go
The things that we can't even give away, I don't wanna know
Try to see if secrets burn when you hold them up into the light
I remember when we loved each other day and night

And high above the water the eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in the jungle is gonna get his wish
