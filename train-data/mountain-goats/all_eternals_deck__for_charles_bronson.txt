For Charles Bronson


Catch a lucky break, try to make it last
Rig a blanket curtain up between the present and the past
Play my lucky numbers for most of what they're worth
Lie about my age right down to my last day on this earth

Set your sights on good fortune, concentrate
Pull back the hammer, try to hold the gun straight

Hit the gym each night, stay cool and seldom speak
Keep the heart of a champion, never let them see you're weak
And whatever they say on your page three mention
Focus on the parts that make you feel good, be grateful for the attention

Set your sights on good fortune, concentrate
Pull back the hammer, try to hold the gun straight

Try to hold the gun straight
And true and steady
Let the frame find you
When the cameraman's ready

Work until I drop
Drift from place to place
Ehrenfield, Pennsylvania
Scratched into my face

Set your sights on good fortune, concentrate
Pull back the hammer, try to hold the gun straight
Try to hold the gun straight
