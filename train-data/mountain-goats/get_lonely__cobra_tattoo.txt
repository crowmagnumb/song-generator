cobra tattoo


sun just clearing the treeline when my day begins.
slippery ice on the bridges, northeastern wind coming in.
you will bruise my head, I will strike your heel.
drive past wind of northern pine, try not to let go of the wheel.
dream at night
girl with a cobra tattoo on her arm,
it's head flaring out like a parachute.

prisms in the dew drops in the underbrush
skatecase sailor's purses floating down in the black needlerush
higher than the stars I will set my throne.
God does not need Abraham, God can raise children from stones.
dream at night
girl with a cobra tattoo
and try to hear the garbled transmissions come through.
