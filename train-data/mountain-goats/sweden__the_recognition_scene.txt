the recognition scene


we broke the doorknob off of the door.
the door swung open easily.
we sauntered into the poorly lit store,
and looked around lazily.
we stole every bit of candy they had inside.
gobbled it all up greedily on our 3 month ride.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

you headed out to the getaway car
and hit the open road
I saw something written in tall clear letters on your face
but I could not break the code.
we had hot caramel sticking to our teeth
and the only love I've ever known burning underneath
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
