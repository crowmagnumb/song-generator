blueberry frost


when you saw the evening star
shining in the freezing sky
i saw something dark and silent passing by

full moon
deep grass
cold water

when you said your name out loud
something broke inside me
nothing new to take ahold of
no new world to hide me

full moon
deep grass
cold water

full moon
deep grass
cold water
