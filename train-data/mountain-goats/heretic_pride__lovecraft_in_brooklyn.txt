lovecraft in brooklyn


it's gonna be too hot to breath today
but everybody is out here on the streets
somebody's opened up the fire hydrant
cold water rushing out in sheets

some kid in a marcus allen jersey
asks me for a cigarette
companionship is where you find it
so I take what I can get

hubcaps on the car like fun house mirrors
stick to the shadows that I can
lovecraft in brooklyn

well the sun goes down on the armies of the voiceless
several hundred-thousand strong
come without their bandages
their voices raised in song

when the street lights sputter out
they make this awful sizzling sound
I cast my gaze towards the pavement
too many blood stains on the ground

rhode island drops into the ocean
no place to call home anymore
lovecraft in brooklyn

head outside most everyday to try to keep the wolves away
imagine nice things I might say
if company should come

woke up afraid of my own shadow
like, genuinely afraid
headed for the pawnshop
to buy myself a switchblade

someday something's coming
from way out beyond the stars
to kill us while we stand here
it'll store our brains in mason jar

and then the girl behind the counter 
she asks me how I feel today
I feel like lovecraft in brooklyn

yeah!
