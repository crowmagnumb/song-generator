song for the julian calendar


sun twinkling on the river this evening
i tasted chocolate on my tongue
darkness climbing up the ladders to the sky
rung by agonizing rung
i heard firecrackers popping next door
wondered what it is i bargained for
when i lay quiet on the floor and you were knocking

let me be your witness
let me walk out on the edge
the sun refused to shine on my backyard today
darkness climbing up the house
coming through the window ledge
i saw the firecrackers bursting on the sidewalk
i heard you talking your baby talk
i saw the bright lights again and
i felt the shock when you were knocking
