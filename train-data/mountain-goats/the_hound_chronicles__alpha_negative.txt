the house was pretty and the yard was wide 
and I felt strong, with you at my side. 
your eyes at night, had a beautiful glowing in them. 
and I knew in my heart, just what was growing in them. 

ah, but you made me drink poison. 
it felt smooth running down my throat. 
I love you. and you made me drink poison. 
it was cool and smooth and sweet. 
do you remember... 

we had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard, 
and I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time. 
I tried to stop the thing matastasizing in us, 
but in the warm, slow evening, 
I could feel it rising in us. 

ah, and you made me drink poison. 
it felt so smooth, sliding down my throat. 
I love you so much. and you made me drink poison. 
it was cool and smooth and sweet and cool 
and smooth and sweet and cool and smooth.
