marduk t-shirt men's room incident


slumped up against the sink
hair plastered to her cheeks
marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin
refugee from a disco in old east berlin

weightless formless blameless nameless

stray syllables were gurgling
from her throat one at a time
face hidden from my view
I let myself imagine she was you

only weightless, formless, blameless, nameless

and when I washed my hands
I ran the water hotter than I could stand

half rising to a crouch
sinking back down to the floor
when you're walking keep your head low
try to leave no traces when you go

stay weightless, formless, blameless, nameless
