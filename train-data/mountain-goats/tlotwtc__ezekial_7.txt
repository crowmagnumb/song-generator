Ezekiel 7 And The Permanent Efficacy Of Grace


The clouds explode and then the desert blooms
Someone will need to mop this floor for me
When I emerge, I find my car
Like a cathedral in a dream of the future

Drive until the rain stops
Keep driving

Pull over and blast off when I get the chance
Clear as an insect's wings in the sunlight
Flip on the high stakes radio
Try to sing the words right

Drive until the rain stops
Keep driving

I had his arms tied up behind him
We were together all day
Maybe make Culiac√°n by sunset
Try to, anyway

High as the clouds now
Flying
Drive until the rain stops
Keep driving
