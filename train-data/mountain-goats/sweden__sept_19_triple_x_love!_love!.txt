sept 19 triple x love! love!


...i bet you don't know...

I cut down that withered peach tree
just like you asked me to.
and I hacked it into pieces
set it on fire with your face in plain view
at the near window where you stood
watching me split the wood
I will do as I am told.
I will keep away the cold.

the fire pit in the snow
gave off a rich bright orange-red glow
a familiar scent rose up into the air 
and I remembered something special from a long time ago
you opened up the door
stepped away from the killing floor
your footprint on the snow was fresh and new
when you touched me I felt fire coming through
I will do as I am told.
I will keep away the cold.
I will do as I am told.
I will keep away the cold.
