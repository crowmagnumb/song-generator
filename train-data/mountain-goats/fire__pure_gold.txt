hey don't touch the door.
because the door will surely kill you.
i hear you saying that you don't see what i mean,
well you better look again.

stop looking at the floor.
because the whole building's turning, and turning, and turning.
and don't touch the door.
can't you see the door's burning?

and all at once the street is filled with light.
and all at once the street is filled with sound.
when i hold you i know our number's being called somewhere.
let them come on down.
